This is very similar to the last example.

!|fitlibrary.specify.log.AppWithLog4j|

The above fixturing code is as follows:
{{{   public class AppWithLog4j {
	private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(AppWithLog4j.class);
	
	public boolean call() {
		logger.trace("App called");
		return true;
	}
   }
}}}
|''configure log4j''|
|''show after''|true|
|''level''|TRACE|

 * On ''Test'', the following has text added after the table, because we've enabled ''show after'' and the level is TRACE:

|''call''|

|''configure log4j''|
|''level''|DEBUG|

 * The following does not add text because the level is DEBUG, so trace() calls are not shown:

|''call''|

|''configure log4j''|
|''level''|TRACE|
|''show after''|false|

 * The following does not add text because we've disabled ''show after'':

|''call''|
