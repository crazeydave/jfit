 * In !-FitLibrary-! we do xpath matching using the '''matches''' keyword:

|get|the cat in the hat|'''matches'''|cat|

 * Of course we could have more simply just used '''contains''' nstead of the matches clause as the match contains no special regex metacharacters. '''contains''' the simpler 'string contains' fixture method :

|get|the cat in the hat|'''contains'''|cat|

 * In regex a '.' means match 'any character',  so we can match 'cat' or 'cap' in the sample phrase with:

|get|the cat in the hat|matches|ca.|
|get|the cap in the hat|matches|ca.|

 * We can can also check something '''does not match''' by using the fixture method with the same name:

|get|the cat in the hat|'''does not match'''|bat|
|get|the cap in the hat|'''does not match'''|ba.|

 * Regular expressions with the matches and contains are both '''case sensitive''':

|get|the cat in the hat|does not contain|CAT|
|get|the cat in the hat|does not match|CAT|
|get|the cat in the hat|does not match|CA.|

 * You can 'or' matches together with the | character: 

!note If you look at the source of this test you'll notice that the | character needs to be escaped in fitnesse with !- !-  -! -!
|get|there is a mouse in the house|matches|!-there is a (mouse|ghost|draught) in the house-!|
|get|there is a ghost in the house|matches|!-there is a (mouse|ghost|draught) in the house-!|
|get|there is a draught in the house|matches|!-there is a (mouse|ghost|draught) in the house-!|
|get|there is a television in the house|does not match|!-there is a (mouse|ghost|draught) in the house-!|
