Consider again the calculator example.
!|fitlibrary.eg.Calculator|

|''total''|10|
----
|+|5|
----
|''total''|15|

Now it would be painful to write a separate storytest for the calculator adding correctly with lots of different numbers.

We look at one approach, using templates. The idea is to generalise the storytest above and allow different numbers to be plugged into it.
 * This is shown here: ^CalculatorTemplate.
Another approach is to use a calculation rule (as shown in .FitLibrary.UserGuide.FitLibraryByExample.CalculationRule).
