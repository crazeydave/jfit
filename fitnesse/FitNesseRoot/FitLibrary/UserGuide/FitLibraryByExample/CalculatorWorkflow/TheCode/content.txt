Here's the first ${storytest} again:
---- * ${setup}
 * An object of the following class is created and wrapped with a ${traverse} to handle ${workflow}
!|fitlibrary.eg.Calculator|
 * The following calls the ${setter} method for ''total'', ''setTotal()''
|''total''|10|
---- * ${actions}
 * The following calls the ${actionMethod} ''plus()'', which is derived from the ${keywords} of the action
|+|5|
---- * ${checks}
 * The following calls the ${getter} method for ''total'', ''getTotal()'' and compares the actual and expected values
|''total''|15|

The class Calculator is as follows:
----{{{  public class Calculator {
	private int total;

	public int getTotal() {
		return total;
	}
	public void setTotal(int total) {
		this.total = total;
	}
	public int plus(int i) {
		total += i;
		return total;
	}
}  }}}----
In general:
 * In the ${setup}, the tables consist of property-value pairs. For each such pair, the value is passed as an argument to the ${setter} of the property.
 * In the ${actions}, each row of a table is treated as an ${action}, with a call to an ${actionMethod}.
 * In the ${checks}, the tables consist of property-value pairs. For each such pair, the value is matched against the value returned by the ${getter} of the property.
