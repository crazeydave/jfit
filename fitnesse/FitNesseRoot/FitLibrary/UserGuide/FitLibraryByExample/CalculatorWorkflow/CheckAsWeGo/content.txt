As we carry out actions, we can check the total. So we don't need a separate ${checks} in that case.
---- * ${setup}
!|fitlibrary.eg.Calculator|

|''total''|10|
---- * ${actions}
|'''check'''|+|5|15|

We don't need a ${setup} either, if we start the calculator in it's initial default state, with a total of 0.
