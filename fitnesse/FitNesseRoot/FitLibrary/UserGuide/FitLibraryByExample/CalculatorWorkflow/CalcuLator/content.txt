We start with a very simple example, a calculator. This ${workflow} ${storytest} consists of three phases, each with tables, separated by horizontal lines:
 * ${setup}, where we specify the initial state of the calculator
 * ${actions}, where we specify some actions that are carried out on the calculator
 * ${checks}, where we specify the final, expected state of the calculator
We can include explanatory text around our tables.
---- * ${setup}
!|fitlibrary.eg.Calculator|
 * Let's start with a ''total'' value of 10 already in the calculator
|''total''|10|
---- * ${actions}
 * Now we carry out an action: add 5
|+|5|
---- * ${checks}
 * We expect that the ''total'' will now be 15
|''total''|15|
!3 Next
 * We can CheckAsWeGo
