A SelectFixture allow more than one do fixture to be used in a single storytest.

For example, a storytest may consist of several parts:
 * Create database tables
 * Call SOAP web services
 * Emulate the user at a browser connected to a web application
 * Check database tables

Each of these may be managed by distinct fixtures.

Here's a simple example of the use of SelectFixture, below.

Two fixtures are added, with names (''first'' and ''second''). Actions are provided to select between the fixtures by name.
