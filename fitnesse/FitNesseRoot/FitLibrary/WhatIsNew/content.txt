One change will break backwards compatibility (as explained further in >June2010Release):

 * A ''defined action'' parameter ''x'' is now referenced in the body of the defined action as ''@{x}''.
 * The previous form of ''defined actions'' parameters can still be used; these are auto-translated at load time, as defined in >June2010Release
