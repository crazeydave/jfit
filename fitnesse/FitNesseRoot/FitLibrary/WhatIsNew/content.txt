|!2 >May2010Release|''Details of changes in this release''|

Some changes may break backwards compatibility (as explained further in >May2010Release):

 * ''!-DomainFixture-!'' is no longer the default wrapper for POJOs
 * ''Template''s have been removed, as they're completely superceded by ''defined actions''
 * The underlying implementation of ''!-FitLibrary-!'' has changed considerably in some areas. This may require recompilation of fixtures that depend on the interbnal implementation.
