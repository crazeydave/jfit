Here are the actions before we've introduced any objects:

|''show actions in scope''|

Now we add an object, so it's added to the scope:

!|fitlibrary.specify.workflow.Keywords|

And the actions are now extended:

|''show actions in scope''|

Note that the top actions have less information. That's because the corresponding methods don't have annotations to provide it.

We can also look for one by partial name:

|''show actions in scope containing''|show|
