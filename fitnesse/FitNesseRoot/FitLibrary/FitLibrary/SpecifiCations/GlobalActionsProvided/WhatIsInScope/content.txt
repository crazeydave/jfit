Run ('''Test''') this page to see the help documentation.

Here are the actions before we've introduced any objects:

|''help''|

Notice that they have tooltips, with further information.

Now we add an object, so it's added to the scope:

!|fitlibrary.specify.workflow.Keywords|

Notice that the first few actions are not in flow style (alternating keywords and data) and don't have tooltips. That's because there is no documentation associated with them.

And the actions are now extended:

|''help''|

Note that the top actions have less information. That's because the corresponding methods don't have annotations to provide it.

Let's add an object into scope (and this has a chain of SUTs):

|'''also run'''|''add object''|

|''help''|

We can also look for those with some text in the name or tooltip:

|''help with''|show|

|''help with''|<|

|''help with''|greater|

|''help with''|file|
