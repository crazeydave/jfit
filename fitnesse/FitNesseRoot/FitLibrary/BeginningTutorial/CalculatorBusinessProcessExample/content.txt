A business process concerns the order that things happen, and their consequences.

|''with a calculator''|

|''given the total is''|10|

|+|5|

|*|10|

|''the total now is''|150|

But we don't get any useful feedback if the expected value is wrong:

|''the total now is''|140|

So we can do this instead:

|''the total now''|'''is'''|140|
